As some of you may know, [Google is killing gchat (aka Google Talk) and moving users to Hangouts](https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2017/03/updates-in-g-suite-to-streamline-hangouts-and-gmail.html) after June 26th. 

> Talk users within Gmail will receive a prompt in the next few weeks, inviting them to switch to Hangouts. After June 26, users will be automatically transitioned to Hangouts, unless contractual commitments apply. For users that preferred the Google Talk look, there is a Dense Roster setting in Hangouts that provides a similar experience.

Some folks [aren't happy about it](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/gchat-good-google-hangouts-bad?utm_source=mbtwitter).

(Though tech sites like Select All are, predictably, kind of [meh about it](http://nymag.com/selectall/2017/03/google-kills-gchat-replaces-with-google-hangouts.html?mid=twitter-share-selectall).)

Personally I think I prefer gchat to Hangouts. Hangouts feels uglier, and I understand that it's a bit more restrictive with regard to third-party applications like Adium and Pidgin, though I could be wrong-- [Google's blog post](https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2017/03/updates-in-g-suite-to-streamline-hangouts-and-gmail.html) says, "Third-party XMPP clients will continue to work with Hangouts for 1-on-1 chats," but continues, "XMPP federation with third-party services providers will no longer be supported starting June 26."

All that aside, more broadly, from my experience neither gchat nor Hangouts allows for easy file transfers or group chat, not to mention mobile access and video calling. Even niceties I've gotten used to on Slack like inline GIFs, furled-out URLs and tweets, easy :emojis:, and editable messages aren't there. I think we deserve a better instant messenger in 2017.

Of course even if you agree with that sentiment, most of your friends may just roll on over to Hangouts and not even notice. The problem here isn't as simple as just downloading a new instant messaging app: barring interoperability with Hangouts (lol), you've got to get at least some of your friends to switch too. But hey, maybe this is the push you need to look around (it was for me).

Alright so let's say you're willing to attempt to take on the beast that is the network effect. What are our current options that aren't Hangouts? You could already be using something like Facebook Messenger or Slack or Skype or WhatsApp and be all set. Congrats! But none of those felt right to me. To see why, let me lay out some things I was looking for in a replacement.

## My Criteria 

But personally I wanted something that, like gchat, (A) worked well on the desktop and (B) didn't require a cell phone number, but also, unlike gchat, (C) was relatively secure. It also had to be super easy to install and use, and hopefully run in as many environments as possible (a solid desktop app at home, in any browser at work, on Android or iOS, etc.)

By "relatively secure", I was hoping for a feature called [end-to-end-encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption), which means that even the service can't read your messages. Wikipedia, [citing Wired](https://www.wired.com/2014/11/hacker-lexicon-end-to-end-encryption/), defines it as such:

> End-to-end encryption (E2EE) is a system of communication where only the communicating users can read the messages. In principle, it prevents potential eavesdroppers – including telecom providers, Internet providers, and even the provider of the communication service – from being able to access the cryptographic keys needed to decrypt the conversation

(The Electronic Frontier Foundation also has a [definition](https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/end-end-encryption).)

If you don't care about encryption that's fine of course. 

## Alternatives

There are a couple of other services that meet some or all of these requirements: there's Slack (too entwined with my work-ish), [Cryptocat](https://crypto.cat/) (no mobile app), [Ricochet IM](https://ricochet.im/) (no mobile apps, uses Tor, which is cool but also tricky in a work environment, and doesn't handle multiple devices very well), [Signal](https://whispersystems.org/) (requires phone number, desktop apps aren't great). 

WhatsApp, which [employs end-to-end encryption](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/04/whatsapp-rolls-out-end-end-encryption-its-1bn-users), is also a decent choice here, but again, the desktop app seemed a bit lacking. Plus, it's owned by Facebook, which has implemented a data sharing scheme that the Electronic Frontier Foundation [wrote about](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/08/what-facebook-and-whatsapps-data-sharing-plans-really-mean-user-privacy-0) and later highlighted as a concern about the service in [a blog post in October 2016](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/10/where-whatsapp-went-wrong-effs-four-biggest-security-concerns). 

## An alternative I like: Wire

One of the alternatives that I like and have already converted some friends to already is [Wire](https://wire.com/en/).

![Wire for Mac desktop screenshot](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/wire-website/ibiza/welcome/welcome-macos-2400.png)

Wire allows file transfers (up to 25MB), group chats, voice calls, GIFs... all the good stuff. In this way, and in its general aesthetic, it reminds me of Slack). But, unlike gchat or Slack, Wire also offers strong, [end-to-end encryption](https://wire.com/en/privacy/). Wire also has good, standalone desktop apps, as well as mobile apps for all major operating systems (Mac, Windows, iPhone, Android, etc.). It also can run right in your browser, which can be nice for being discreet at work. 

You don't need to provide Wire with your cell number, even if you want to use it one your phone (you'd just use a username, like gchat). Note that you _can_ add a cell number to your Wire account if you so choose.

### A smattering good security things about Wire

Wire's end-to-end encryption is turned on by default (as opposed to something like Facebook Messenger or [Google's Allo](https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/18/googles-allo-wont-include-end-to-end-encryption-by-default/), which is [not great](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/09/googles-allo-sends-wrong-message-about-encryption)) and just works-- normal users don't have to think about it. But if you're interested, below I write out a few things I've slowly learned about Wire's security.

Wire's [apps](https://github.com/wireapp/wire) and [now server code](https://medium.com/@wireapp/open-sourcing-wire-server-code-ef7866a731d5) are open source, meaning the code is published on the internet. This is _generally a good thing_ for software, especially software that promises strong security, since the code can be reviewed and investigated by experts outside of the company. Relatedly, Wire was [audited by an independent security firm in February](https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/10/messaging-app-wire-now-has-an-external-audit-of-its-e2e-crypto/), and the discovered problems have apparently been fixed.

Wire even recently got the coveted Snowden recommendation on [a "Pod Save the People" episode](https://art19.com/shows/pod-save-the-people/episodes/cedb8657-71d7-4ab3-b41c-ce705dfa71ac) (in which he highlights the fact that you don't need to give Wire you phone number).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;If you don&#39;t want to to share your phone number […] use Wire.&quot; Thanks for recommending Wire, <a href="https://twitter.com/Snowden">@Snowden</a>! <a href="https://t.co/cq2eDH6uvY">https://t.co/cq2eDH6uvY</a></p>&mdash; Wire (@wire) <a href="https://twitter.com/wire/status/865499400021303297">May 19, 2017</a></blockquote>

### What about metadata?

I should note that Wire [stores more metadata (as reported by Joseph Cox on Motherboard)](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/secure-messaging-app-wire-stores-everyone-youve-ever-contacted-in-plain-text) than something like [Signal](https://whispersystems.org/). Cox writes:

> [Wire] has decided to keep a list of all the users a customer contacted until they delete their account... To be clear, this isn't necessarily a security concern everyone needs to worry about: it depends on your own threat level, Wire users don't have to use a phone number to sign up, and clearly Wire has made a decision to store customer data like this. But, for some users, it may be something they want to bear in mind.

For completeness sake, here's [Wire's sort-of response](https://medium.com/@wireapp/product-design-decisions-for-secure-messengers-e8a5e7d1a373) to these metadata revelations-- Wire's CTO told Cox "We are specifically exploring alternative ways to handle connections between users in the context of multi-device messaging." My understanding is that Wire stores the contact lists of users unencrypted for as long as the account exists, which isn't good if you want the fact that you're communicating with someone to be a secret. 

I think this is fine for everyday conversation between friends-- it's certainly more privacy-respecting than Google Hangouts. This is a trade off for better usability. For a gchat replacement that offers end-to-end encryption of the contents of my messages, I'm OK with that.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">.<a href="https://twitter.com/wire">@wire</a> has come a long way in the last year. I can see it overtaking Signal as the app of choice.</p>&mdash; the grugq (@thegrugq) <a href="https://twitter.com/thegrugq/status/848309432924557312">April 1, 2017</a></blockquote>

## Things you might not like about Wire

I've been using Wire on my laptops and iPhone for a few weeks now. Honestly I don't have many faults with it, but here are some in case any of them completely revolt you. 

One thing I don't love is that Wire's desktop app can't get that small on my desktop. On my 13" MacBook Air, its minimum size is almost exactly one quarter of the screen. Something like Adium or gchat in your Gmail tab is a bit more discreet. This might get in the way of your other work, or make you feel weird about using Wire's desktop app in the office. Of course you can have it running in a browser tab and just switch away from it when your boss walks by. 

Also, most times when I'm using the desktop app with my iPhone on my desk, I'll get notified that I've received a Wire message, even though I've already read it and could be in the process of responding to it on my laptop. I've gotten used to this though, and it probably could be fixed through code somehow. 

I've sometimes, rarely, gotten duplicated messages from a contact, though this usually only happens when I'm not present. It happens rarely and never when I'm actually in a back-and-forth conversation.  Similarly, a month or so ago I noticed a slow-down in message delivery when using Wire in a browser. I group these two complaints together because I'd categorize them as bugs that will likely be noticed my many users and fixed quickly, if they haven't been fixed already.

Lastly, if you're looking for something more secure, I'm pretty confident that you'd be better off with Signal. 

## How to get Wire

It's super easy. Go to [https://app.wire.com/auth/?connect#register](https://app.wire.com/auth/?connect#register) and create an account. You can then use Wire right in your browser or download the desktop app ([here's the macOS one](https://itunes.apple.com/app/wire/id931134707?mt=12)). That's it! 

Afterward, if you so choose, you can download the iOS or Android app (search your app store and look for the Wire logo) and log in with your new account there. You can then search for others on Wire by username or phone number. Or you can gchat them, scare them a little about the June 26th date, and then send them to Wire. That's basically what I've been doing.
