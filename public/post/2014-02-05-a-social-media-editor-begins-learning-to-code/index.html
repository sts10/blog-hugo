        <p><em>This post has been re-published from <a href="http://schlinkblog.tumblr.com/post/74943612048/a-social-media-editor-begins-learning-to-code-or-my">my personal Tumblr</a> with some edits</em>.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, January 8th I packed up my things and left my first real job.</p>

<p>Two years earlier I had <a href="http://newsweek.tumblr.com/post/10690131520/hey-we-hired-an-intern">started as an intern</a> at <em>Newsweek</em> &amp; The Daily Beast, eventually becoming the deputy social media editor. 28 months and tens of thousands of tweets later, I willingly sent in my resignation letter.</p>

<p>A few days later I had already un-followed nearly 200 accounts on Twitter, disconnected The Daily Beast&rsquo;s official Twitter accounts from my phone and my TweetDeck, and cleaned up my Chrome Bookmark Bar. I&rsquo;d be lying if I said I hadn&rsquo;t been looking forward to this digital cleanse (sorry to all you horse-race political reporters who have one fewer follower).</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Working at <em>Newsweek</em> &amp; The Daily Beast was an incredible experience, especially during the 2012 election, and I am unquestionably a smarter, stronger person than I was when I left my parents house to go to that interview in 2011.</p>

<p>But in some ways it feels like I&rsquo;m leaving at a time when the future of the &ldquo;social media editor&rdquo; at news websites seems uncertain. As more and more reporters and editors join and learn to use Twitter, writing good tweets and Facebook updates will become less of a valuable skill. Covering breaking news live with social media tools will also become a more common skill (or at least it will at successful publishers).</p>

<p>Also, as Facebook referrals become a higher percentage of total site traffic, editors are becoming more dependent on Facebook&rsquo;s Newsfeed algorithm: essentially a blackbox of code that determines what appears in users&rsquo; feeds whose whims social media editors can only guess at. (To get an idea of how sensitive some publishers are to the algorithm, <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/publishers-nervously-await-the-facebook-correction">read Charlie Warzel&rsquo;s piece about how worried they are about whether or not a recent boost in Facebook referrals will soon end</a>.) Not to mention that social media editors have little to do with <em>organic</em> social referrals&ndash; i.e. people who come to the publisher&rsquo;s site via a friend&rsquo;s post on Facebook or Twitter, rather than one posted from one of the organization&rsquo;s accounts.</p>

<p>I still think Twitter is fun, but some folks say it&rsquo;s becoming <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/25/valley-of-the-blahs-how-justin-biebers-downfall-exposed-twitters-achilles-heel/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0">less of a new source and more of a crappy cocktail party</a>.</p>

<p>Journalism in general seems to be going through some rather unsightly growing pains as it continues to adapt to new technology available to both journalists and readers. Without a universal metric for &ldquo;engagement,&rdquo; editors will keep chase page-views because that&rsquo;s what advertisers want to see. Content management systems (CMSs) continue to be years behind the current needs of most organizations, meanwhile the ever-multiplying Upworthys, Viral Novas, and other narrative-porn-pushers of the web are making Buzzfeed&rsquo;s listicles seem respectable. Not to say there&rsquo;s no <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/01/the-newsonomics-of-why-everyone-seems-to-be-starting-a-news-site/">hope</a> for news online. But for now I&rsquo;m taking a break.</p>

<p>So what is next for me? As I tweeted earlier this month, I will be attending the <a href="http://flatironschool.com/">Flatiron School</a> in Manhattan this spring to learn how to code. I want to make things that are more permanent than a tweet or Tumblr post or even an online news article.</p>

<p>The 12-week web development course focuses on a programming language called Ruby and one of its associated web frameworks, Ruby on Rails. While I&rsquo;ve used HTML, CSS, and Javascript before, including at The Daily Beast, Ruby will be completely new to me. (For a fun, non-technical introduction, check out <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2012/03/ruby_ruby_on_rails_and__why_the_disappearance_of_one_of_the_world_s_most_beloved_computer_programmers_.html">Annie Lowrey on the disappearance of _why</a>.)</p>

<p>The class itself doesn&rsquo;t start until February 3rd, so this month I&rsquo;ve been working my way through what Flatiron calls <a href="http://prework.flatironschool.com/web-development/">&ldquo;pre-work&rdquo;</a>: some basic foundational work, from HTML to Git to basic Ruby and Rails, that will help everyone be on more-or-less the same page come day one. It&rsquo;s nice to work on my own schedule again&ndash; I&rsquo;ve been naturally sleeping in and staying up pretty late. At first I was a little anxious about this, but I quickly learned to embrace a college-like work/sleep schedule.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s this &ldquo;pre-work&rdquo; like so far? It&rsquo;s been a lot of advanced CSS and, more recently, an introduction to Ruby (I&rsquo;ll be drilling in a basic Git workflow and hopefully setting up Rails this upcoming week). For the Treehouse and Code School courses that Flatiron recommends, it&rsquo;s watching short videos and then taking little quizzes (both services are about $25 per month for all-you-watch). Code Academy&rsquo;s lessons (which are free!) are just text and coding exercises.</p>

<p>When I need a break I try to see people in real life (<a href="http://thebillfold.com/2013/11/tips-for-the-suddenly-unemployed-from-the-recently-suddenly-unemployed/">rules are important</a>). I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://schlinkblog.tumblr.com/post/74806974593/recent-longreads-of-note-work-why-the-ideal">a few books</a>. I played Gears of War 2 from beginning to end over three weekdays. When I&rsquo;m not watching instructional videos, I&rsquo;ve found that Grateful Dead has been a pleasant, don&rsquo;t-freak-out coding soundtrack for me. From time to time I check Twitter, a community I interacted with almost constantly for two years, to get a feel for what&rsquo;s going on. But generally, for the first time in two years, I&rsquo;ve kept TweetDeck closed, unconcerned with keeping track of all of Twitter&rsquo;s wonderful inside jokes, or being up-to-speed on what today&rsquo;s big outrage is.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been nice.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll try to blog more going forward&ndash; the school encourages it. Not sure if I&rsquo;ll stick with this Tumblr, or even the Tumblr platform I once loved so much. Whatever I decide, I&rsquo;ll be sure to let you know.</p>
