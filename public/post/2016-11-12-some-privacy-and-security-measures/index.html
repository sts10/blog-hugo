<p>In addition the books mentioned above, I got most of my information from two of my favorites social networks: Reddit and Twitter.</p>

<p>Mostly through a collection of subreddits like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy">r/privacy</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/privacytoolsIO">r/privacytoolsIO</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/security">r/security</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto">r/crypto</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/encryption">r/encryption</a> I got some basic information and found some well-regarded privacy guides:</p>

<h2 id="disclaimers-etc">Disclaimers, etc.</h2>

<p>So let&rsquo;s get this out of the way: <strong>I am just learning and am far from an expert</strong> and I encourage readers to double check all of my recommendations made here with outside sources that you feel good about trusting. When possible I try to link out to the source of where I got specific tips or recommendations. If anything, I&rsquo;ve learned that there&rsquo;s no silver bullet here, and that you should not put your life or anything too important in the hands of software.</p>

<p>Below is what I have learned and some of my subsequent actions&ndash; things I have done given the information I gathered and ultimately trusted enough. If not specified, software and links included assume you&rsquo;re using OS X / macOS (apologies if I switch between the names for Apple&rsquo;s desktop operating system). I mostly wrote this all down as an exercise for myself, but I figured it&rsquo;d be nice to publish if I ever need to refer to it or point others to it. Again, not an expert. Say it out loud if it helps.</p>

<p>If you see something wrong or misleading here, or you have suggestions, feel free to <a href="https://twitter.com/sts10">tweet at me</a> or send me a PGP-encrypted email (which I discuss below). <a href="https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0x5BF6E5C2B80500F2">Here&rsquo;s my public key</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-learned-and-what-i-did">What I Learned and What I Did</h2>

<h3 id="passwords">Passwords</h3>

<h4 id="what-i-learned">What I Learned</h4>

<p>From what I gathered, the basic idea with passwords is that you want (a) to enable two-factor authentication whenever possible and (b) do your best never to re-use a password between multiple services.</p>

<p>Turning on two-factor authentication means that whenever you log into your account, a code will be sent to your phone that you&rsquo;ll have to enter after entering your correct password. The idea here is that even if an attacker gets your password, they would also need your phone to get this code. As <a href="https://medium.com/@mshelton/securing-your-digital-life-like-a-normal-person-a-hasty-and-incomplete-guide-56437f127425#.zf9977k7v">Shelton writes</a>: <a href="https://www.google.com/landing/2step/">Gmail</a>, <a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/20170388">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/148233965247823">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/en/help/363">Dropbox</a>, and <a href="https://twofactorauth.org/">a number of other services</a> allow two-factor authentication.</p>

<p>For all your other services (and even the ones that you have two-factor turned on for), you&rsquo;re going to want different passwords for each service. That&rsquo;s because, as Shelton writes in <a href="https://medium.com/@mshelton/password-managers-for-beginners-d1f49866f80f#.w2pvjawj1">his password managers guide</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you use the same password everywhere, a hacker only needs to get your password once in order to break into many of your online accounts. And it seems like every week, we hear about a massive new password breach. For example, Yahoo recently announced that passwords for 500 million Yahoo users were breached in 2014. Imagine if an attacker used your single, easy-to-remember password to access your health care records, your home address, credit card numbers, or your social security number. (You can check if your password has already been leaked here.) To minimize the damage from a breach, you should use unique passwords on each account. But it can be a challenge to remember each password.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To keep track of all those unique passwords, it seems that the best solution is to effectively put all your apples in one basket and use a password manager with a (very) strong master password.</p>

<h4 id="what-i-did-password-manager">What I Did (Password Manager)</h4>

<p>At first I used <a href="https://www.keepassx.org/">KeePassX</a>, a great, open-source, no-nonsense password manager. I still use it and for some more secure stuff like my banking account information and trust it. But with KeePassX I didn&rsquo;t find an easy, trusted way to access these stored passwords on my iPhone or on other computers. I could sync the encrypted database file via Dropbox or Google Drive, but I still wouldn&rsquo;t be able to access it on my iPhone.</p>

<p>To solve this problem, I paid $50 for what I think is a lifetime of <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a>. This is a slicker password manager, with more features than KeePassX. For example you can install a Google Chrome extension that automatically fills in usernames and passwords for the page you&rsquo;re on. It also syncs with Dropbox seamlessly for you (if you so choose to put your encrypted password file on the cloud), and they have an iPhone app for accessing your passwords. This allows me to sign in both on my phone and, if I wish, on other computers.</p>

<p>Note that I did not sign up for a 1Password <em>account</em> by which I mean their service that stores your passwords on their servers for a monthly fee. The distinction between these two setups is a bit confusing to me still&ndash; to be honest I&rsquo;m not even sure the plan I have is still available to new users. This is one of the downsides to 1Password in my mind&ndash; it&rsquo;s a little tricky to understand what&rsquo;s what. This and other unnecessary complexity and its incompatibility with Linux are downsides for me. For these (admittedly specific and small) reasons I may be switching back to KeePassX and live without being able to access my passwords on my smartphone. If you want the mobile and Chrome extension features, I don&rsquo;t really have a problem recommending 1Password or LastPass.</p>

<p>At this point, for most services I have a randomly-created password stored in my 1Password vault, and almost none of them are duplicates. (Both KeePassX and 1Password are able to generate random passwords for you.) See EFF&rsquo;s article on <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/node/23/">Creating Strong Passwords</a> for more.</p>

<p>For creating strong but memorable master passwords (which you obviously can&rsquo;t store in a manager, since they&rsquo;re used to open the password vault), I sometimes use a technique recommended in <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/node/23/">the EFF guide linked to above</a> called <a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/03/26/passphrases-can-memorize-attackers-cant-guess/">Diceware passphrases</a>, which I find absolutely fascinating.</p>

<h4 id="what-i-did-2-factor-authentication">What I Did (2-Factor Authentication)</h4>

<p>I also have two-factor authentication enabled on almost all the services I use that offer it. I prefer using a neutral app like <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en">Google Authenticator</a> to get the codes (rather than receiving an SMS text message with the code), as I find it more convenient than waiting for a text. Plus the National Institute of Standards and Technology <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/25/nist-declares-the-age-of-sms-based-2-factor-authentication-over/">advise against using SMS in two-factor schemes</a>.</p>

<p>What happens if you lose your phone? One solution is to use a backup code, which most services give you when you enable 2-factor for just this reason (<a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1187538?hl=en">here&rsquo;s more info on GMail backup codes</a>). Store these somewhere safe obviously, like on a piece of paper you store somewhere secure. Once you use a backup code to login, you can choose to temporarily disable two-factor authentication until you get your phone back or get a new one.</p>

<h3 id="browser-use-and-tracking">Browser Use and Tracking</h3>

<h4 id="what-i-learned-1">What I Learned</h4>

<p>Most broadly, most services we use on the internet make money, either directly or indirectly, from tracking what we look at online. Google places ads related to what you&rsquo;ve recently searched for, Twitter serves ads based on who you follow, Facebook serves ads based on nearly everything you tell it. Separately, thanks to third-party companies you&rsquo;ve never heard of, these internet services can easily share information about you. Think about how after do one casual search for lawnmowers on Amazon you see ads for those products follow you around the web.</p>

<p>A year or even six months ago I would have shrugged this off. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s how Amazon&rsquo;s recommendations are so good&rdquo; or &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like lawnmowers are illegal&rdquo; or even the standard &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have anything to hide, so&hellip;&rdquo; are the types of reactions I might have had. (If you hold this belief and would like to challenge it try <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcSlowAhvUk">this Glenn Greenwald TED Talk</a>.)</p>

<p>For a variety of reasons my views have apparently shifted, through reading and observing my habits. There was actually one concrete occurrence that freaked me out and drove me to action: While trying to learn more about Linux I must have, at my apartment, done some Googling in Google Chrome about different distributions of Linux. Shortly there after, while at work, Twitter started suggesting I follow Linux-related accounts. I didn&rsquo;t like that idea that a topic I&rsquo;d Googled at home was now appearing on a website I had to use for work, and furthermore that that information about me was stored <em>somewhere</em> on a server where I couldn&rsquo;t delete it or even read it.</p>

<p>If you want to feel a little more paranoid, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has a tool called <a href="https://panopticlick.eff.org/">Panopticlick</a> that attempts to show you to what extent and how you&rsquo;re being tracked through your browser.</p>

<h4 id="what-i-did">What I Did</h4>

<p>First, I split my browsing activity at home between two browsers. If I was using a service that necessitated use of my real name or a credit card, I used Google Chrome. This includes online banking, GMail, Twitter, Facebook, Github, Netflix, etc. For everything else I used Firefox (or, now a days, the Tor Browser). This includes random search queries (especially about privacy issues!), most Reddit use, most Youtube watching, etc.</p>

<p>Then, on both my home and office installations of Google Chrome, I went to Settings &gt; Advanced sync settings and unchecked everything.</p>

<p>On my home installation of Chrome, I then installed two extensions created by the EFF relating to privacy: <a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere">HTTPS Everywhere</a> and <a href="https://www.eff.org/privacybadger">Privacy Badger</a>. Descriptions from HTTPS Everywhere&rsquo;s official page:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Many sites on the web offer some limited support for encryption over HTTPS, but make it difficult to use. For instance, they may default to unencrypted HTTP, or fill encrypted pages with links that go back to the unencrypted site. The HTTPS Everywhere extension fixes these problems by using clever technology to rewrite requests to these sites to HTTPS.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And from Privacy Badger&rsquo;s:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Privacy Badger is a browser add-on that stops advertisers and other third-party trackers from secretly tracking where you go and what pages you look at on the web. If an advertiser seems to be tracking you across multiple websites without your permission, Privacy Badger automatically blocks that advertiser from loading any more content in your browser. To the advertiser, it&rsquo;s like you suddenly disappeared.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On Firefox, where I might be running into weirder websites, I was a little more aggressive with my add-ons, choosing to take all of the recommendations from <a href="https://www.privacytools.io/#addons">privacytools.io</a> (though I saw the add-ons they recommend cited by other sources as well).</p>

<p>Thus on my Firefox I have <a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere">HTTPS Everywhere</a>, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/decentraleyes/">Decentraleyes</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dillbyrne/random-agent-spoofer">Random Agent Spoofer</a>, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/self-destructing-cookies/?src=api">Self-Destructing Cookies</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock">uBlock Origin</a> all installed. (I used to use <a href="https://disconnect.me/">Disconnect</a> but that extension is no longer recommended by privacytools.io) I also set the default search engine to Duck Duck Go rather than Google, as they claim not to track users.</p>

<p>I then tweaked my Firefox to further enhance the privacy of the browser by using <a href="https://www.privacytools.io/#about_config">these settings</a> recommended by <a href="https://www.privacytools.io/">privacytools.io</a>.</p>

<p>You can read more about setting up your browser for privacy and security in <a href="https://github.com/drduh/macOS-Security-and-Privacy-Guide#browser">the &ldquo;Browser&rdquo; section of the macOS Security and Privacy Guide</a> I link to above.</p>

<p>In both Chrome and Firefox, these extensions rarely interfere with my normal browsing, but they&rsquo;re all easy to temporarily disable. I could be more intense with both by disabling JavaScript or taking other, more extreme measures, but this seems to be a good balance for me.</p>

<p>More recently, I decided to try the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en">Tor Browser</a> on an old MacBook Pro that <a href="https://sts10.github.io/blog/2016/11/07/installing-ubuntu-on-my-old-macbook-pro/">I recently installed Linux on</a>. I found that, from a user&rsquo;s perspective, it&rsquo;s really just a more secured version of Firefox&ndash; nothing scarier. You can easily avoid visiting the dark/deep web by simply browsing the normal internet, or &ldquo;surface web&rdquo;, as you normally do. The difference from using regular Firefox is that your connection uses Tor.</p>

<p>That established, I have now also installed the Tor Browser on my main MacBook. The Tor Browser runs a version of NoScript (<a href="https://noscript.net/getit">website</a>, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/noscript/">Firefox add-on download page</a>) by default, which may cause some pages to load incompletely, but I haven&rsquo;t found it to be much of a nuisance and have left it on for security reasons.</p>

<p>From the Tor Browser&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en">main landing page</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Tor software protects you by bouncing your communications around a distributed network of relays run by volunteers all around the world: it prevents somebody watching your Internet connection from learning what sites you visit, it prevents the sites you visit from learning your physical location, and it lets you access sites which are blocked. Tor Browser lets you use Tor on Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux without needing to install any software. It can run off a USB flash drive, comes with a pre-configured web browser to protect your anonymity, and is self-contained (portable).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;d also encourage potential users to read <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/download.html.en#warning">Tor&rsquo;s list of warnings to consider</a> and <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en">FAQ</a> before downloading and using the browser. Tor&rsquo;s documentation is located <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/documentation.html.en">here</a>.</p>

<p>I also looked into a new browser called <a href="https://www.brave.com/">Brave</a>, a relatively new open source browser that has ad-blocking and privacy features built in. As I see it the pros are that you get some of the benefits you get from some of the add-ons I mention above right out of the box. Brave also comes bundled with a password manager of its own, but you can switch that out for 1Password, Dashlane, or LastPass. The cons are that you, currently, can&rsquo;t add other extensions to your liking. For these reasons, I have it installed on my iPhone, but stick with Tor and Chrome when on desktop.</p>

<p>Note that when using version 0.12.9 of Brave for OS X you need to <a href="https://github.com/brave/browser-laptop/issues/468#issuecomment-255938042">enable &ldquo;Google Widevine&rdquo; support</a> to use services like Netflix in the browser. Also, in regard to the advantages that the Tor Browser provides over Brave, apparently Brave developers are <a href="https://twitter.com/bcrypt/status/798383317959602176">looking into adding Tor support for Brave</a> (<a href="https://github.com/brave/browser-laptop/wiki/Brave-Tor-Support">GitHub link</a>), which would be pretty interesting!</p>

<h2 id="encrypting-your-hard-drive">Encrypting Your Hard Drive</h2>

<p>A lot of the guides I found recommend encrypting your computer&rsquo;s hard drive. As <a href="https://medium.com/@mshelton/securing-your-digital-life-like-a-normal-person-a-hasty-and-incomplete-guide-56437f127425#.dcxdkpedk">Shelton writes</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Encrypt your hard drive.</strong> If your device is ever lost or stolen, it&rsquo;s easy for thieves to take data off your hard disk. Good news: If you have a new password-protected iPhone <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202064">your disk is already encrypted</a>. If you have an Android Device, <a href="https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/2844831">it&rsquo;s pretty easy to encrypt your phone</a>. A few Android phones (in the Nexus line) are <a href="http://nexus%205x%2C%206p%2C%206%2C%209/">encrypted by default</a>. For your laptop or desktop, you can encrypt your hard drive using your operating system&rsquo;s native software: <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204837">FileVault for Mac</a>, or <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2308725/a-beginners-guide-to-bitlocker-windows-built-in-encryption-tool.html">BitLocker on Windows</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I actually <em>haven&rsquo;t</em> done this yet (on my Mac it would mean enable FileVault) as I&rsquo;m little freaked out about straight-up forgetting my password or screwing it up in some other way, but you should consider it!</p>

<h2 id="communication-texts-instant-messaging-and-email">Communication (Texts, Instant Messaging, and Email)</h2>

<h3 id="what-i-learned-2">What I Learned</h3>

<p>Basically you want to communicate using tools that encrypt your communications such that not even the toolmaker can read them, even under threat from the law. This feature is generally known as &ldquo;end-to-end encryption&rdquo; and a number of services advertise having it. There&rsquo;s bonus points if the service you&rsquo;re using obfuscates or hides your meta-data, as well as the contents of your communication, though this seems to be difficult to get from a service at this point.</p>

<p>Gchat, Facebook Messenger, and normal SMS have neither of the features mentioned above, at least by default as of this writing. Facebook <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/10/05/technology/facebook-secret-conversations-mode/index.html">now offers &ldquo;Secret Conversations&rdquo;</a>, and Google has released Allo, which has an &ldquo;incognito&rdquo; mode, but neither service turns on end-to-end encryption by default (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/18/googles-allo-wont-include-end-to-end-encryption-by-default/">&ldquo;Google&rsquo;s Allo won&rsquo;t include end-to-end encryption by default&rdquo;</a>).</p>

<p>Not enabling the encryption by default is a bigger issue than I originally assumed. EFF wrote on their blog that, with Allo, Google is <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/09/googles-allo-sends-wrong-message-about-encryption">&ldquo;teaching the wrong lessons about encryption&rdquo;</a>, not to mention confusing users about what &ldquo;incognito&rdquo; means.</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Google&#39;s decision to disable end-to-end encryption by default in its new <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Allo?src=hash">#Allo</a> chat app is dangerous, and makes it unsafe.

<h4 id="on-your-phone">On Your Phone</h4>

<p>For phone-to-phone texting and calling, a lot of people recommend <a href="https://whispersystems.org/">Signal</a>. <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/read/signal-downloads-spiked-after-election-results">Downloads of the application have spiked since the US election results</a>, which is good as you can only communicate with other Signal users, and it recently <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/11/08/trust_it_results_of_signals_first_formal_crypto_analysis_are_in/">passed an audit</a> (though I am not sure how legit the organization behind the audit is).</p>

<p>True, there are a handful of iPhone + Android apps that offer end-to-end encryption (notably <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/download/">WhatsApp</a>), but as <a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/11/12/surveillance-self-defense-against-the-trump-administration/">Micah Lee writes</a> when discouraging organizers from using Facebook groups:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All of the messages you send to groups of people using these apps will be end-to-end encrypted. No one, not even the app developers who have access to the servers these apps use, will be able to read the plaintext of your messages, except for the other members of your group.</p>

<p>But while the messages are encrypted, the list of members of the group might not be, and this is also important information to protect. <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/download/">WhatsApp</a> and Semaphor might be able to hand over group membership information if the government comes knocking.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the developer of Signal, Open Whisper Systems, is <a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/06/22/battle-of-the-secure-messaging-apps-how-signal-beats-whatsapp/">way ahead of the game</a> here. The one time they <a href="https://whispersystems.org/bigbrother/eastern-virginia-grand-jury/">received</a> a request for data about a Signal user, all they were technically able to hand over to the FBI was the account creation time and the last date that the user connected to the Signal server — they didn&rsquo;t have the users’ contacts, they didn&rsquo;t have a list of groups they were in or members of those groups. The company also successfully fought a gag order designed to keep them from publicizing the request. That said, Signal groups can be buggy, have scaling issues when groups get too big, and at the moment there are far fewer people using Signal than there are using WhatsApp.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>EFF also has some <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/10/where-whatsapp-went-wrong-effs-four-biggest-security-concerns">concerns about WhatsApp</a> as of October 2016.</p>

<p>The New York Times&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/07/technology/personaltech/worried-about-the-privacy-of-your-messages-download-signal.html?_r=0">Brian X. Chen recommends Signal to his readers</a>, and Snowden is also a fan:</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I use Signal every day. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/notesforFBI?src=hash">#notesforFBI</a> (Spoiler: they already know) <a href="https://t.co/KNy0xppsN0">https://t.co/KNy0xppsN0</a></p>&mdash; Edward Snowden (@Snowden) <a href="https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/661313394906161152">November 2, 2015</a></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/08/how-the-clinton-campaign-is-foiling-the-kremlin">The Clinton campaign also used it</a>.</p>

<p>Signal is <a href="https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-iOS">open source</a> and is licensed under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html">GPLv3</a>. Its founder is Moxie Marlinspike, a charismatic computer security researcher recently <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/07/meet-moxie-marlinspike-anarchist-bringing-encryption-us/">profiled in <em>Wired</em></a>. Also, Signal <a href="https://whispersystems.org/blog/signal-desktop-ios/">recently released a desktop client for iPhone users</a>, meaning you can send messages to your Signal contacts from your desktop.</p>

<p>Note that <a href="https://sandervenema.ch/2016/11/why-i-wont-recommend-signal-anymore/">there are some complaints</a> that it has a what I understand to be a small dependency on Google Cloud Messaging. But given <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12883410">this response from Marlinspike</a> and <a href="http://dephekt.net/2016/11/10/managing-security-trade-offs-why-i-still-recommend-signal.html">another blog post responding to the GCM issue</a>, I&rsquo;m not too concerned. It seems like any security trade-off is worth it for making the app easier to install and use.</p>

<h4 id="desktop-to-desktop-messaging">Desktop-to-Desktop Messaging</h4>

<p>I also found a desktop-only messaging app called <a href="https://ricochet.im/">Ricochet</a> which uses the Tor network in an attempt to obfuscate or &ldquo;eliminate&rdquo; metadata of your conversations. From their documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ricochet uses the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en">Tor network</a> to reach your contacts without relying on messaging servers. It creates a <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services.html.en">hidden service</a>, which is used to rendezvous with your contacts without revealing your location or IP address. Instead of a username, you get a unique address that looks like ricochet:rs7ce36jsj24ogfw. Other Ricochet users can use this address to send a contact request - asking to be added to your contacts list.</p>

<p>You can see when your contacts are online, and send them messages (and soon, files!). Your list of contacts is only known to your computer - never exposed to servers or network traffic monitoring.</p>

<p>Everything is encrypted end-to-end, so only the intended recipient can decrypt it, and anonymized, so nobody knows where it&rsquo;s going and where it came from.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ricochet&rsquo;s website goes on to warn that the software is &ldquo;an experiment&rdquo; and that &ldquo;Security and anonymity are difficult topics, and you should carefully evaluate your risks and exposure with any software.&rdquo; However Ricochet was audited in January 2016 (<a href="https://ricochet.im/files/ricochet-ncc-audit-2016-01.pdf">PDF</a>) and <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/read/ricochet-encrypted-messenger-tackles-metadata-problem-head-on">Joseph Cox of Motherboard says it passed</a>.</p>

<p>I like its design&ndash; you don&rsquo;t have a password and you don&rsquo;t pick a username. As I understand it your identity is connected to the computer you&rsquo;re using and the (private) key file that is created and stored on your computer when you install the software. More on Ricochet&rsquo;s design <a href="https://github.com/ricochet-im/ricochet/blob/master/doc/design.md">here</a>. Ricochet is open source (<a href="https://github.com/ricochet-im/ricochet">GitHub</a>) and can be <a href="https://github.com/ricochet-im/ricochet/blob/master/BUILDING.md">built from source</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll also mention <a href="https://crypto.cat/">Cryptocat</a>, another desktop-only, open source encrypted messaging app. Cryptocat is mentioned by name as a good option in <em>Data and Goliath</em>, and it allows file transfers which is nice. One thing to note is that previous version(s) of the app were criticized for a lack of security, but, after re-writing the program, the developer has now asked security-minded users to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/4fyzyc/cryptocat_rewritten_from_scratch_invitation_to/?st=ivgs41yw&amp;sh=c25b60a8">take a second look at the code</a>.</p>

<p>Lastly, in this section I should also note that the EFF has a <a href="https://www.eff.org/secure-messaging-scorecard">Secure Messaging Scorecard</a> though the current version, they admit, is out of date. They&rsquo;re currently working on an updated version.</p>

<h4 id="email">Email</h4>

<p>For email there&rsquo;s always good ole <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy">PGP (&ldquo;Pretty Good Privacy&rdquo;)</a>, for which I wrote <a href="https://sts10.github.io/blog/2015/07/01/my-basic-understanding-of-pgp-encryption/">a basic explainer when I first learned how to use it</a>. Shelton, in <a href="https://medium.com/@mshelton/security-compromises-in-journalism-4cc32ba0709d#.sofplhy72">a new Medium post called &ldquo;Security Compromises in Journalism&rdquo;</a>, writes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>PGP is a protocol for encrypting messages, and it&rsquo;s become a tool both security specialists and journalists both love to hate. Today, its open source implementation, GnuPG, is widely used by journalists and media activists around the world to encrypt the body of their emails. PGP isn&rsquo;t easy to set up, and once it&rsquo;s running, users can very easily make mistakes. For example, users can send an encrypted message using an incorrect or expired key, essentially making the message unreadable to the recipient.</p>

<p>Glenn Greenwald, who broke the early Snowden disclosures with the Guardian, is perhaps one of the most famously resistant PGP users. Edward Snowden provided detailed instructions on how to set up the protocol, but Greenwald held off for months. In an interview, I asked Greenwald about the challenges of using PGP. He told me, &ldquo;PGP hasn&rsquo;t really evolved that much since [the 1990s] in terms of being user friendly because it&rsquo;s mostly been used by nerds and hackers, and people who almost like the fact that it&rsquo;s so complicated.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As Shelton observes, PGP is (still) difficult to use, but <a href="https://gpgtools.org">GPG Tools</a> makes it easier for Mac users (they also have <a href="https://gpgtools.tenderapp.com/kb/how-to/first-steps-where-do-i-start-where-do-i-begin-setup-gpgtools-create-a-new-key-your-first-encrypted-mail">a guide for new users</a>).</p>

<p>This set of tools includes GPGMail, &ldquo;an open source plugin for Apple Mail&rdquo; which does seem to make the process easier when using OS X&rsquo;s default mail app. However, for encrypting email with PGP, both <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/how-use-pgp-mac-os-x">the EFF</a> and the <a href="https://emailselfdefense.fsf.org/en/mac.html">Free Software Foundation</a> recommend using Thunderbird and Enigmail. If you use Gmail&rsquo;s web interface, you can look in to <a href="https://www.mailvelope.com/">Mailvelope</a>. I&rsquo;m sure there are other plugins and pieces of software that attempt to make usage easier.</p>

<p>I admit I don&rsquo;t have a full grasp of how to use PGP. For example, the idea of signing the keys of others, as described in <a href="https://emailselfdefense.fsf.org/en/mac.html">the FSF guide</a>, continues to elude me. Regardless, my public PGP key is <a href="https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0x5BF6E5C2B80500F2">here</a>. I&rsquo;ve also purchased a YubiKey and put a new PGP key on it, <a href="https://sts10.github.io/blog/2016/12/06/yubikey-and-gpg/">which you can read about</a>.</p>

<p>As you might expect, it&rsquo;s difficult to get friends into PGP, so I haven&rsquo;t used it to communicate in a while. However I have found GPG Tools&rsquo; &ldquo;GPG Services&rdquo; (included in GPG Tools) useful for quickly encrypting specific files on my Mac, either for safe storage or safely emailing to myself.</p>

<p>To avoid Google reading my email, realistically I&rsquo;d have to get off of GMail. One alternative that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/11/signups-for-encrypted-mail-client-protonmail-double-after-election/">many are flocking to recently</a> is <a href="https://protonmail.com/">ProtonMail</a>, a provider based in Switzerland that encrypts emails between ProtonMail users, and is <a href="https://github.com/ProtonMail/WebClient">open source</a>. I&rsquo;m honestly not sure how difficult it would be for me to change email addresses these days, as I&rsquo;ve had the same GMail address since 2005. But it might not be too hard, given that I doubt my email address gets typed out that often, and when it does it gets auto-completed.</p>

<h3 id="what-i-did-1">What I Did</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve yet to use any of these encrypted services to communicate with others in a meaningful way, since they all require both users to adopt the service. For that reason I&rsquo;m hopeful that both Signal and ProtonMail are reporting a surge in new users recently.</p>

<h2 id="additional-resources">Additional Resources</h2>

<p>This <a href="https://blog.witness.org/2016/11/getting-started-digital-security/">Witness blog post</a> pointed me to a few of the guides I link to above, including to <a href="https://securityinabox.org/en">Security in a Box</a>.</p>
