                    Thanks in part to my two days of jury duty last week, I was able to speed through two books about information technology and computers recently. The first one, which was recommended to me, is called The Master Switch by Tim Wu, and the second is Hackers by Steven Levy.
First, Master Switch. Wu is a law professor at Columbia University, and his 2010 book is a satisfyingly dense history of information technology.

                    Last week I attended a class on basic digital security at the BuzzFeed office, which included some basic encryption techniques. Before the class I knew nothing about how PGP encryption works, but now that I&rsquo;ve got a bit of a handle on it I figured I&rsquo;d lay down what I know so far here. I&rsquo;m going to err on the side of practical rather than philosophical here, since that was the gist of the class.

                    Today Twitter announced that users can export and import lists of blocked users. I don&rsquo;t have the feature on my personal account yet, but a co-worker did and I saw that when you do export, you download a CSV file (Comma Separated Values&ndash;basically a software-agnostic spreadsheet). I&rsquo;m assuming the import side of the feature expects the same file format.
I think this is super, super important. I&rsquo;ve written previously about why I want all my application preferences to be stored as text&ndash; the main reasons are (1) your settings become extremely portable, and (2) your settings become very easy to share.

                    Earlier today BuzzFeed published these 17 Desktops So Untidy They Will Make You Seriously Uncomfortable. From experience I know that since by default OS X saves screenshotted images to your Desktop, they often contribute to Desktop clutter.
I&rsquo;ve written about how I take screenshots before, but just to be thorough, I thought I&rsquo;d write my own version of this insightful Lifehacker post on how to change OS X&rsquo;s default screenshot format and location.

                    At that subtle moment when man glances backward over his life, Sisyphus returning toward his rock, in that slight pivoting he contemplates that series of unrelated actions which become his fate, created by him, combined under his memory&rsquo;s eye and soon sealed by his death. Thus, convinced of the wholly human origin of all that is human, a blind man eager to see who knows that the night has no end, he is still on the go.

                    Note: Neither of the solutions presented herein are quite right, so like, read through the post before you just start installing stuff.
I was poking around Life Hacker just now and found an interesting post on an Automator workflow called TextFlow. LH claimed that it allowed users to quickly and easily format text with options like &ldquo;sentence case&rdquo; or &ldquo;title case,&rdquo; something that I&rsquo;ve been meaning to research for a while now.

                    In my eight months at BuzzFeed I&rsquo;ve written a fair bit of code when the occasion calls for it.
I wanted to share what I think is a particularly good bit of code I&rsquo;ve pushed to the BuzzFeed servers. It&rsquo;s not flashy or &ldquo;clever&rdquo; or particularly efficient&ndash; just a simple JavaScript block mostly dedicated to basic control flow and variable assignment. What I like about it is the problem it solves for the project it lives in (a screenshot-building tool).

                    Everyone here who knew Gary will recall that if you spent time in his company, you were always laughing. You spent half the day laughing, he spent half the day laughing, or so it seemed, at least if he was in the company of other people&hellip;I would say in that laughter there was something of the terrible laughter of Eastern Europe.
I remember another moment: I was with Gary going into the Museum of Modern Art one time, pushing through the revolving doors.

                    I recently started using a text editor called Vim. For the uninitiated, Vim is a lightweight text editor often used for writing code. It comes pre-loaded on some if not all remote servers. Since it&rsquo;s designed to be used without a mouse, there are tons of keyboard shortcuts to learn. This part isn&rsquo;t a huge deal&ndash; for now just know that Vim is a text editor, like Notepad or Sublime Text or Word.

                    A few months ago I wrote a post about my first time tipping a toe in the water of Vim, an intensely keystroke-based text editor. Despite getting the basics down, I still did 95% of my coding in Sublime Text 2, my old go-to editor.
However in the last few weeks I had a need for a fresh project to take up, and, considering that at least some of my future work will be on remote servers which will force me away from editors like Sublime Text, I figured I&rsquo;d resume my exploration of Vim.
