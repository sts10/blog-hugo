                    Troublingly, I&rsquo;ve taken very few notes during lectures at Flatiron. How will I remember niche methods and strange, counter-intuitive syntaxes?!
Of course, we do have awesome labs that we can reference anytime. Whenever I have needed to remember how I used inject that one time, or how to set up a module, I just remember which lab we did that in. The problem with this approach, of course, is that as the course progresses my labs directory has grown seemingly exponentially.

                    Over the weekend I’ve been working a new side project in order to get more practice generating dynamic webpages using ERB. I’m calling it Recall and it’s supposed to take a Ruby method as a user input from the command line and then dynamically generate a new webpage that displays every time you’ve used that method, complete with the code line, the line number, and a link to the .

                    “What we fight with is so small, and when we win, it makes us small. What we want is to be defeated, decisively, by successively greater things.”
— Rainer Maria Rilke
 At the end of this past week we dug deeper into object-oriented programming— by which I mean using Ruby classes as models of things like jukeboxes, songs, schools, and students. At the same time, our programs grew from simple, single-file projects rarely exceeding 100 lines to folders containing multiple files within subfolders all interacting with each other just so.

                    I’ve been playing with my color theme and default font-face in my code editor, Sublime Text 2, this cold, snowy weekend, so I thought I’d share a little about my current application setup. I don’t know, maybe this is boring? Self-involved? I try not to get too bogged down in tricking out my gear (while I should be writing code). But on the other hand, now that I’m using my computer even more than I have in the past, I do think it’s important to get it feeling right and looking good.

                    I’m happy to announce that I’ve made some decent improvements to ink, my shell script for making Octopress blogs a little easier. I’ve just pushed version 0.0.4, which introduces two new improvements.
First, installation of 0.0.4 is easier for new users, as they no longer have to create a local Git branch called “drafts” to use ink’s draft functionality. Thanks to this little if statement: if [[ $(git branch | grep &lsquo;ink_drafts&rsquo;) == &ldquo;&rdquo; ]] The script can now see whether the user has an “ink_drafts” branch created or not.

                    Phew! My brain has been hurting (in a good way) for the first time in years. Looking back over the last 7 days, I’d say I spent at least 14 hours a day dealing with code. The best metaphor I can think of is that part in the Matrix when they plug Keanu Reeves in so he can learn things quickly. That’s what it feels like.
Not to imply that it’s been all easy-going exactly.

                    A Contextualizing Introduction Before I became a student at the Flatiron School I was a journalist of sorts, most recently as a social media editor at The Daily Beast. I’ve always been interested in what the media industry calls Content Management Systems (CMS)— the software that a publication uses to publish its product. The CMS dictates their workflow, and therefore effects everything from their response time to breaking news to how well they can present long-term, complex interactive projects.

                    The pace is starting to pick up! Today marked our first tepid steps into Ruby, introducing not only a new topic, but a new way of thinking required by the course: programming logic.
This morning we got a quick intro to RSPEC, which is basically a way to test pieces of Ruby code. For the course, it works as an auto-grader of our work that we can run as many times as we like before turning in our code (we now submit our work via GitHub forking and pull-requesting).

                    It’s day 2 and I’m already thinking about my computer differently. As Avi says, for us it will become more of a tool to build things and less of a device to consume media (he doesn&rsquo;t like iPads either!).
After going over some more Git stuff in the morning, today’s lecture and the focus of the exercise following it was about Bash and setting up our “development environment.” I had been looking forward to this— it’s like that part in a video game where you get to upgrade all your stuff.

                    What a luxury it is to be a student again! It&rsquo;s amazing to raise your hand, ask a question, and get a definite answer. Hell, even when our T.A.s (T.A.s!) gave us cryptic answers to our questions, I was ecstatic.
Day one at the Flatiron School was all about Git and GitHub. From the minute we got in (9 am) we worked on creating little student profiles and a a group index page just like this one.
