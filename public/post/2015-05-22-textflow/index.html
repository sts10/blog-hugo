<p><em>Note: Neither of the solutions presented herein are quite right, so like, read through the post before you just start installing stuff.</em></p>

<p>I was poking around Life Hacker just now and found <a href="http://lifehacker.com/textflow-adds-tons-of-text-formatting-options-to-os-x-1706298617">an interesting post</a> on an Automator workflow called <a href="https://github.com/vmdanilov/TextFlow">TextFlow</a>. LH claimed that it allowed users to quickly and easily format text with options like &ldquo;sentence case&rdquo; or &ldquo;title case,&rdquo; something that I&rsquo;ve been meaning to research for a while now. I found success with <a href="http://lifehacker.com/quickly-change-os-xs-default-screenshot-format-and-loc-1489014578">a Life Hacker post on saving screenshots</a> a while back, so I was down to try this out.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>First off, I didn&rsquo;t even know OS X had a built-in application called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automator_%28software%29">Automator</a> until I read this post. Definitely something to check out going forward. But for now let&rsquo;s talk about TextFlow.</p>

<h3 id="why-i-want-this-functionality">Why I Want This Functionality</h3>

<p>At work I often have to convert headline case into more-soothing-to-read sentence case for Tweets or Facebook posts. I also sometimes have to change smart punctuation to &ldquo;dumb&rdquo; punctuation. Note that these aren&rsquo;t needs I have when coding&ndash; it&rsquo;s usually during general usage or social media stuff.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always meant to investigate a method for doing this more efficiently than the arrow keys or, in Sublime Text using Command+d, but I had never really found one that worked&hellip;</p>

<h3 id="textflow-installation-experience">TextFlow Installation Experience</h3>

<p>Intrigued by the promises made in the Life Hacker post, I headed on over to <a href="https://github.com/vmdanilov/TextFlow">the TextFlow github repo page</a> and followed the installation instructions. I then chose to only install &ldquo;Paste and Transform Text&rdquo; and &ldquo;Transform Selected Text&rdquo;. I installed these two &ldquo;workflows&rdquo; by simply double clicking those files and selecting the install option. I avoided installing the &ldquo;Paste as Plan Text&rdquo; workflow because I&rsquo;ve grown quite used to OS X&rsquo;s default &ldquo;paste as plain text&rdquo; functionality (invoked via the Shift + Command + v shortcut) and didn&rsquo;t want to screw with that.</p>

<p>Once I had installed those two workflows, I restarted Chrome, typed some text into a new GMail window, highlighted the text and went up to Chrome &gt; Services &gt; Transform Selected Text. And I think on the first try I was presented with the menu that the <a href="https://github.com/vmdanilov/TextFlow/raw/master/screenshots/screenshot-textflow-transforms.png">GitHub readme describes</a>, with options like &ldquo;Sentence Case&rdquo; and &ldquo;Title Case&rdquo;. And it seemed to work, but&hellip;</p>

<h3 id="problems-with-textflow">Problems with TextFlow</h3>

<p>Strangely, when I converted some text to Title Case and then tried to convert the same text to Sentence Case, nothing happened. I then learned that Life Hacker had picked this up from <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9585115">a Hacker News post from a day ago</a>. I then re-examined <a href="https://github.com/vmdanilov/TextFlow">the GitHub repo</a> and realized this thing is pretty new and thus bugs may be present. However I submitted <a href="https://github.com/vmdanilov/TextFlow/issues/3">an issue</a> to the repo and <a href="https://github.com/vmdanilov">vmdanilov</a> fixed it promptly. I re-installed and it&rsquo;s working better now.</p>

<h3 id="an-alfred-workflow">An Alfred Workflow</h3>

<p>Discouraged by this solution after finding a bug so quickly, I Googled for another way to transform text quickly. I came upon this <a href="http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/2180-case-converter-including-title-case/">pair of Alfred workflows</a> and decided to give them a try (note: Alfred work-flows are, I believe, only available if you buy the <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/">PowerPack</a>, which is totally worth it for clipboard history alone).</p>

<p>I installed both the standard version and the hotkey version. On the standard version I made the one that simply &lsquo;changes the case of the text on the clipboard&rsquo; from &ldquo;case&rdquo; to &ldquo;casec&rdquo; and the one that converts the clipboard text AND pastes from &ldquo;casep&rdquo; to &ldquo;case&rdquo; since I figured I&rsquo;d use that more often. Then on the hotkey version I made paste in sentence case (the last hotkey -&gt; script listed) Control + Option + Command + v and paste in title case (the first hotkey -&gt; script listed) Control + Shift + Option + Command + v.</p>

<p><img src="http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/vagqvtrtjjvcjho/2015-05-22%20at%2010.28%20PM.png" alt="Alfred Case Hotkeys settings" /></p>

<p>However this solution isn&rsquo;t as smooth as I&rsquo;d want it to be either. The hotkeys work in Chrome but there&rsquo;s a bit of a lag (by design I think) and seem to either insert a carriage return at the end of the pasted text or navigate the cursor one line down. The standard version works in Sublime (no shortcut overlap) and is a bit quicker I think, if you can accept having to call Alfred and type &ldquo;case&rdquo; each time.</p>

<p>Going forward the Alfred route isn&rsquo;t bad, but I think the search continues. Ultimately I want one that uses the OS X dictionary when applying sentence case, so that proper nouns (places, famous and common names, etc.) get or stay capitalized. If you have an a solution that you like, <a href="http://twitter.com/sts10">hit me up on Twitter</a>.</p>

<h3 id="update">Update</h3>

<p>As I mentioned above, I submitted <a href="https://github.com/vmdanilov/TextFlow/issues/3">a GitHub issue</a> for TextFlow and the sentence case works great now. I changed the keyboard shortcuts to Option + Control + v for paste and Option + Control + t for transform. It&rsquo;s working in Google Chrome (where I thin kI need it most often), but not in Sublime Text 2&ndash; again, perhaps due to shortcut overlap problems.</p>

<p>But yeah, if you just want to use this in your browser(s), I&rsquo;d recommend the new version of <a href="https://github.com/vmdanilov/TextFlow">TextFlow</a>, roughly following the installation process I outline above (though I&rsquo;d check the GitHub page to see if anything has changed since I wrote this).</p>
